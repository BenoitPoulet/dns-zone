A Ruby library for building, parsing and manipulating DNS zone files.

## Installation

Add this line to your Gemfile:

    gem 'dns-zone'

And then execute:

    bundle install

Require the gem in your code:

    require 'dns/zone'

## Usage

### Loading a zone file

    zone = DNS::Zone.load(zone_as_string)

### Loading a zone file, without an `$ORIGIN` directive

    zone = DNS::Zone.load(zone_as_string, "example.com.")

### Creating a new zone programmatically

    zone = DNS::Zone.new
    zone.origin = 'example.com.'
    zone.ttl = '1d'
    
    # quick access to SOA RR
    zone.soa.nameserver = 'ns0.lividpenguin.com.'
    zone.soa.email = 'hostmaster.lividpenguin.com.'
    
    # add an A RR
    rec = DNS::Zone::RR::A.new
    rec.address = '127.0.0.1'
    zone.records << rec
    
    # output using dns zone file format
    zone.dump

# Development

## Development Commands

    # install external gem dependencies first
    bundle install

    # run all tests and build code coverage
    bundle exec rake test

    # hints where to improve docs
    bundle exec inch

    # watch for changes and run development commands (tests, documentation, etc)
    bundle exec guard

# TODO

## Must have

    [x] Ability to load a zone made of multiple RR's
    [x] Add support for RR Type: SOA
    [x] Add support for RR Type: NS
    [x] Add support for RR Type: MX
    [x] Add support for RR Type: AAAA
    [x] Add support for RR Type: A
    [x] Add support for RR Type: CNAME
    [x] Add support for RR Type: TXT
    [x] Add support for RR Type: SRV
    [x] Add support for RR Type: PTR
    [x] Add support for RR Type: SPF
    [x] Add support for RR Type: HINFO
    [x] Support loading zone where some records have an empty label

    [x] Add support for RR Type: NAPTR (RFC 3403)
    [x] Add support for RR Type: SSHFP (RFC 4255)

    [ ] Add test using real bind zone file, with DNSSEC RR's.
    [ ] Add support for DNSSEC (RFC 4034) RR Types:
        [x] DNSKEY
            [ ] Algorithm may be integer or mnemonic.
        [x] RRSIG
            [ ] Algorithm may be integer or mnemonic.
        [x] NSEC
            [ ] Handle "Type Bit Maps" better, much better...
        [x] DS
    [ ] Add support for DNSSEC (RFC 5155) RR Types:
        [x] NSEC3
        [x] NSEC3PARAM
        [ ] Correctly handle "Presentation Format" as defined in RFC.

    [x] Add support for DNSSEC (RFC 4431 & RFC 7344) RR Types:
        [x] CDNSKEY (identical to DNSKEY)
        [x] CDS (identical to DS)
        [x] DLV (identical to DS)

    [ ] Look at newly added DNSSEC RR's and rename fields to be more appropriate, where required.

## Would be nice

    [ ] Basic validation, error checking:
        [ ] Only one SOA per zone.
        [ ] CNAMEs can't use a label of `@`.
        [ ] PTR zones have some extra conditions:
            [ ] labels cant be repeated
            [ ] names should end in a dot, otherwise they are invalid after expansion
            [ ] IPv4 and IPv6 cant be mixed

    [ ] Ability to 'include' defaults/records into a zone.
        This may or may not mean supporting the `$INCLUDE` directive.

## At some point; low priority

    [ ] Configuration options:
        [ ] spaces/tabs used between RR params in zone file output
        [ ] time format used in output (should parse both formats, seconds or bind time format (e.g. 1d))
            [ ] add comments to explain TTL's that are in seconds
    [ ] Ability to add comment to RR (n.b. currently we strip comments when parsing)
    [ ] Add support for RR Type: LOC (RFC 1876)
    [ ] Add support for RR Type: DNAME (RFC 2672)
    [ ] Add support for RR Type: KEY
    [ ] Add support for RR Type: RP
    [ ] Add support for RR Type: RT
    [ ] Add support for RR Type: CAA (RFC 6844)

# Misc. Development Notes

- RR Format: `[<TTL>] [<class>] <type> <RDATA>`
- A DNS zone is built from RR's and a couple of other special directives.
- If zone file does not include $ORIGIN, it will be inferred by the `zone "<zone-name>" {}` clause from bind.conf
  In general we should always explicitly define an $ORIGIN directive unless there is a very good reason not to.
